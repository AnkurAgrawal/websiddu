      <div class="section-body">
        <p>While working in Web2.0 Innovation labs, TCS, I designed a chrome extension for an enterprise social networking application(knome), as my side project. This was later released as an official product. I am the only designer and developer for this project. I handled everything for this product from user experience design, development to deployment. </p>
        <p> To give some background Knome is a enterprise social networking application similar to Microsoft Yammer enabling social interaction in work place. Knome had a web and mobile application.</p>
        <strong>The problem </strong>
        <br>
        <blockquote>
          <span class="icon icon-left-quote"></span> How can we make Knome experience better and convenient for the power users.

      <div class="section-body">
        <p> I conducted multiple focus groups with the power users to understand what they need and how the content should be presented to them. I found pretty interesting things, here are some of them the users needed.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Navigate thought different community/timeline views.</li>
          <li>Able see multiple community posts at a time.</li>
          <li>Quickly able to comment/like/share any post.</li>
          <li>Notification are very important. </li>

        <p>I sketched many ideas about how to solve this problem. Most of them are completely wild ideas as I was not thinking about the implementation. We had a functional website which is not solving the power users problem. I was looking at sites like <span class="text-normal">Pintrest, Flipboard, TweetDeck, Hootsuite, Feedient and many more.</span>. Each have one common thing like horizontal scroll. It turns out that with horizontal scroll we can present more content in one place at a time. There were many things that didn't work initially.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to paper prototypes, I eliminated the designs that didn't work in the initial usability testing.

          <p> There are many reasons why my initial logo didn't work. Here are some reasons that I thought later about why it didn't work..</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I guess the choosing as theme color and using a fireball didn't work well.</li>
            <li>And the alignment was horizontal. Normally fireballs don't travel horizontal. They either go up or down.</li>
            <li>And the line is under "me" is way too serious and too professional. Which didn't go well with the theme that I choose.</li>
            <li>Many thought that was a <strong>Fish</strong> #fail. </li>

          Showing a lot of content in one screen can be a solution for giving quickly accessible content. At the same time there should be readability to make sure that users is not overwhelmed by the amount of content. So I choose a mix of <span class="text-normal">image and text.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The stream based system will enable the users to craft the screen according to their need and interests. The user can re-arrange, delete any streams that they don't need. Enabling <strong>Keyboard shortcuts</strong> is one other solution for quickly accessing the content.

          For re-arranging streams, I designed a separate modal instead of making the streams itself draggable. Because, Lets say, if the user wants to move the first column to the somewhere at the end. The user will host the first column and keep dragging until it reaches the end, this interaction is <span class="text-normal">time consuming and not accurate. </span> The design I had will give the top level over of the streams and user can easily rearrange things. More over the feedback in the background makes the interaction more intuitive.

          This was my <strong>side project</strong>. I worked on this project after office hours. I wanted to share my idea with my managers and no resources were allocated to this particular project. So, I learned angular.js and developed a version of the application and presented to my managers. Everyone, liked the idea and design. Later they made this as a official product and I owned that product. Here are some quotes.
